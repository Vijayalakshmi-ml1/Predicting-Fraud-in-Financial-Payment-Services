# Predicting-Fraud-in-Financial-Payment-Services

Paysim synthetic:is dataset of mobile money transactions. Each step represents an hour of simulation. This dataset is scaled down 1/4 of the original dataset which is presented in the paper "PaySim: A financial mobile money simulator for fraud detection".The main technical challenge it poses to predicting fraud is the highly imbalanced distribution between positive and negative classes in 6 million rows of data. . The goal of this analysis is to solve both these issues by a detailed data exploration and cleaning followed by choosing a suitable machine-learning algorithm to deal with the skew. I show that an optimal solution based on feature-engineering and extreme gradient-boosted decision trees yields an enhanced predictive power of 0.991, as measured by the area under the precision-recall curve. Crucially, these results were obtained without artificial balancing of the data making this approach suitable to real-world applications.
